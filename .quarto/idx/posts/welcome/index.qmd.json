I love that it makes me feel so capable. It has helped me realize that I want to do this in some level as a part of my career. I'm seeing the possibilities to make tutorials on how to make ML models, wrangle data, and use software. There's even a [Bookdown](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html) option just referred to as \"Books\" (looking at you Tennyson) and an option to make [slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/). Both of these can be done quite easily with existing software but these are now under the unbrella of Quarto. \n\nI use [Quarto's repo](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/) to get ideas for my website and how to code it up. Recently I was attempting to make buttons and found an example on the repo. I was able to make two simple buttons that did function as intended to other pages in the website, but they looked totally different than what I was expecting. Later I asked Brother Hathaway what the code is that is used to make the code, he informed me that it is CSS. Now I'm excited to learn more about CSS!\n\nThere's many things that I want to learn about and Quarto will serve as my notepad. Just recently thanks to Sir. Stack \"CTR+C CTR+P\" Overflow, I learned how to embed PDF's into my QMD file. Here's an example using the Forcats cheatsheet: \n\n\n<iframe src=\"factors.pdf\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\">\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.219","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Thoughts on Using Quarto","author":"Brigham Eaquinto","date":"2022-20-22","categories":["Quarto","reflection"],"html":{"geometry":["top=30mm","left=20mm"]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
