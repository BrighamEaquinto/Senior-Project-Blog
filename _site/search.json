Honestly even more than the six that we had would be beneficial.\nThe starter code was very useful also.\nThe dropdown box for the correct code seemed less than effective. A few of the student’s didn’t realize it was an option.\nThere should also be a note to instructors page that helps instructors know how to use the website and suggestions on how to run the class.\nI was the most prepared for this lesson out of all of them so far and it was also the smoothest lesson. One thing that helped it go more smoothly was that those that came were more familiar with the process and there were less people to corral."
