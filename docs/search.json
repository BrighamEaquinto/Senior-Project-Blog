    "text": "Yesterday’s Class\nYesterday was week four of Bootcamp. This week we had four regulars and two newcomers. The whole lesson was on grouping and summarising.\nI told them that next week we’ll learn how to make plots. There was a positive reactio.\nI really like how it worked last semester. Before we got into the code, we went over histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and barplots on the white board. The goal was to think of datatypes of each column before we put things into plots.\n\n\nReflections for Improvement\n\nIdeas for onboarding new people (Beginner’s Starting Guide?):\n\ncreate a QR code to a place on the website for beginner\n\nbeginning survey\njoining Slack and bootcamp channel\nlink to installation page (page already made)\nwhat about an explanation for total beginners about what R is used for?\ndescription of the RStudio interface\n\nlink that cheetsheet\n\n\n\nMake many exercises like this week’s practice had. Honestly even more than the six that we had would be beneficial.\nThe starter code was very useful also.\nThe dropdown box for the correct code seemed less than effective. A few of the student’s didn’t realize it was an option.\nThere should also be a note to instructors page that helps instructors know how to use the website and suggestions on how to run the class.\nI was the most prepared for this lesson out of all of them so far and it was also the smoothest lesson. One thing that helped it go more smoothly was that those that came were more familiar with the process and there were less people to corral."

    "text": "This process of using Quarto to build cirriculim has been a blast for me honestly! I love that it makes me feel so capable. It has helped me realize that I want to do this in some level as a part of my career. I’m seeing the possibilities to make tutorials on how to make ML models, wrangle data, and use software. There’s even a Bookdown option just referred to as “Books” (looking at you Tennyson) and an option to make slides. Both of these can be done quite easily with existing software but these are now under the unbrella of Quarto.\nI use Quarto’s repo to get ideas for my website and how to code it up. Recently I was attempting to make buttons and found an example on the repo. I was able to make two simple buttons that did function as intended to other pages in the website, but they looked totally different than what I was expecting. Later I asked Brother Hathaway what the code is that is used to make the code, he informed me that it is CSS. Now I’m excited to learn more about CSS!\nThere’s many things that I want to learn about and Quarto will serve as my notepad. Just recently thanks to Sir. Stack “CTR+C CTR+P” Overflow, I learned how to embed PDF’s into my QMD file.

    "text": "This lesson on ggplot was very similar to how I structured the previous lesson. I upped the number of exercises from six last week to 8 for this week. It worked well since I went over four plots: histograms, bar plots, boxplots, and scatter plots. There are two exercises for each, one easy one and one without any starter code.\nBasically I talked for about five minutes explaning the four charts and then I turned them loose to do the eight exercises. I think two of the six in attendance got all 8 finished.\nCompared to last semester I’d say I taught the differences between each of the plots better. For that lesson it was just Danen and I drew the four on a white board. This semester I’d say I taught them better how to write the code for each plot. Now I should take the best of both and merge them together!\n\n\nFirst Comment\nI asked one of the normal attendees (I should totally know his name…) about his experience so far. He said that his biggest struggle so far is understanding all of the lingo. He specifically mentioned ggplot and knowing what it was used for. I imagine he has trouble remembering the wrangling verbs too. He noted that he understands that he’s only had about 5 hours accumulativly of data science practice for only one hour a week and that he’s in CIT 110. Total noob. We all started there though.\nSecond Comment\nOne thing I was hesitant on was I thought that I took all the fun out of getting into making plots. I remember in Data Wrangling we were all so excited to get into this and make cool plots! The excitement stayed true too because it was my favorite week in that course. The plots we made were about 12 lines of code deep. We got into specifics like naming legend titles, taking the log of the axis, faceting, and more. For the practice I had everyone do today, the plots were a total of two lines of code, the ggplot() line, then the geom functions.\nOne of the students calmed my fear when she commented about how she much prefers these simple exercises of simple two-lines-of-code plots over the exercises in Data Wrangling that get hairy very quickly. She dropped Data Wangling because it was too much for her, so this bootcamp is a great fit for her.\n\n\n\nBridger helped a new comer get R and RStudio get up and going. This was his very first experience with analytics–bone dry experience. Once he was set up on his computer, Bridger asked me where he should start. I still didn’t have a good beginner friendly experience going on the website yet. I even found a good introductory video last week but I didn’t put it in yet.\n\n\n\nSomething I’m considering doing is making a slideshow using “revealjs” and embedding it at the top of each lesson. Also, what about a video for each lesson too? It could be me going through the slides and the contents of the lesson, or it could be the same information but taught differently.\nAlso, the thought crossed my mind that if I finish this website and get everything the way that I like, this might be worthy as an example in the Quarto examples page. Maybe I could for their repo and submit a pull request for it!"
